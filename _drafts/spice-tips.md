Let's face it - the deep dark depths of your larder are a scary place that jarred spices go to die. 

If you have young spices around, tell them to avert their eyes from the below, or they will have anything but sweet dreams.

If the [Michael McIntyre spice sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvi0ZLEHj3A) resonates with you, as it certainly does with me, you have probably forgotten a fair few jars of spice in your time at the back of the kitchen cupboard. You will have built up a supply of cumin the size of a pyramid as a little niggle of doubt pops into your head every time you are in the supermarket as to whether you do in fact have any. 

So, I'm going to introduce you to our spice storage solution. I'm sure someone has thought of this spice storage solution before, but for some reason: 

a) Supermarkets still seem to insist on selling spices in jars 
b) People still seem to keep spices in the jars when they get home 

The idea came to us when we bought some very sensibly packaged sumaq in a pouch and wondered why all herbs and spices didn't come like that. They take up less space, you can see how much you have left and it's super easy to make yourself a little index box to store them. Ours looks like this:

I think it should be pretty simple to work out how to do. I'm not going to explain it, just get good strong clear plastic bags (Amazon or Ebay are a good bet) at a reasonable size (ours are 100 x 150 mm). Then either find, or remodel yourself a box to hold them nice and snugly. 

TADA! You will never lose a spice again. And, because it is less of a headache to remember what we have, we use the spices far more. No more sad sage.
