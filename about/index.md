>"Oh don't worry about me, it's my fault for being difficult..."

I hear this regularly from my vegetarian friends when I invite them over for dinner.  

**Vegetarians** think they are a burden for asking their meat eater friends to *indulge* them by sacrificing one less chicken because they are asking their friends to put additional strain on their creativity by forcing them to cook two meals. 

**Meat eaters** silently stress out that they have to come up with another meal and make it somehow interesting.

The usual outcome when a meat-eater cooks for a/multiple vegetarian/s is that we plan the main meal and then the vegetarian afterthought. This usually results in something totally out of keeping with what the meat eaters are having, such as the eponymous **stuffed pepper of doom**.* 

The meat eaters get a beef wellington. The veggies: a stuffed pepper. That's perfectly fair, right?

# I am the use case: 

Let's make one thing clear. 

**I am not a vegetarian. I don't think I ever will be. Those bacon sandwiches are just too good.** 

But I do have a lot of friends who are. I am regularly in a situation where I have to cook for both meat eaters and vegetarians at the same time. I have regularly struggled to find plans and recipes to help me tackle this problem and have to make a lot up. 

I figured that there must be other people who share my pain. Maybe, I should share the solutions I have devised, and ask others to share theirs. 

## And so, Rage Against the Stuffed Pepper was born. 

I set out to write a cookbook and out came an all consuming life project. *Project: Extermination of the Vegetarian Afterthought.* 

This is an experiment. For the next year, I will collect, curate and invent recipes which give equal treatment to both vegetarian and meaty eaters. I will subject my friends to culinary experiments and I will write about the results. 

### The Rage Against the Stuffed Pepper Principles 

1. These recipes are specifically designed so that meat eaters and vegetarians can eat roughly equivalent meals. 
2. Just defaulting to a vegetarian meal is cheating, there are plenty of good vegetarian recipe books out there if you want to take that approach. This approach will not satisfy the carnivores in my family! 
3. All recipes are rated on their similarity based on: 

* *Process* - how similar the process for cooking the two variants is. Recipes are favoured where they e.g. take roughly the same cooking time, use similar ingredients (apart from, obviously the meat), cost a similar amount, use the same number of pots and pans etc. 
* *Presentation* - how similar do the two dishes look when they are presented? 
* *Taste* - this is a crude measure, I don't want to force dishes to be identical if it spoils them. What I am looking for, however, is a similar balance of smoky, sweet, fruity, anisey (if that is even a word)...

### Beyond that... 

We will see. If this proves popular, maybe there will be a book after all.

* <small> I recognise that it is perfectly possible to make very tasty stuffed peppers. However, for artistic purposes, we shall maintain the pepper bashing until we get to a place where we have proved the point. Thereafter the meat and vegetable kingdoms shall be united and at the marriage feast, we shall serve both meat eaters and vegetarians the appropriately stuffed variant. </small>
