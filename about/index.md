## A vegetarian comes to tea

<p> I am not a vegetarian. I suspect I never will be. </p>

<p> There are multiple reasons for this. The most important is that I just like meat too much. Second most important is that the lack of imagination with which may of my vegetarian friends are fed would make me run a mile. </p> 

<p>  </p> 

<blockquote>"Oh don't worry about me, it's my fault for being difficult..."</blockquote>

<p> It all just seemed a bit <strong><em>imbalanced</em></strong></p>

## The veggie afterthought 

One thing always makes me uncomfortable, serving people two different dinners, particularly when one was very clearly an afterthought... 

## And so, Rage Against the Stuffed Pepper was born. 

This is an experiment. For the next year, I will collect, curate and invent recipes which give equal treatment to both vegetarian and meaty eaters. 

### The Rage Against the Stuffed Pepper Principles 

1. These recipes are specifically designed so that meat eaters and vegetarians can share a table, eating roughly equivalent meals. 
2. Just defaulting to a vegetarian meal is cheating, there are plenty of good vegetarian recipe books out there if you want to go for that. I know that would not satisfy the carnivores in my family! 
3. All recipes are rated on their similarity based on: 

* Process - how similar the process for cooking the two variants is. Recipes are favoured where they e.g. take roughly the same cooking time, use similar ingredients (apart from, obviously the meat), cost a similar amount, use the same number of pots and pans etc. 
* Presentation - how similar do the two dishes look when they are presented? 
* Taste - this is a crude measure, I don't want to force dishes to be identical if it spoils them. What I am looking for, however, is a similar balance of smoky, sweet, fruity, anisey (if that is even a word)...


### Beyond that... 

We will see. If this proves popular, maybe I will keep going.
