A quick post about spice storage. 

We all know the problem, you have 50 jars of spices which all look the same from the top. You have 5 jars of cumin because every time you cast a quick glance across, you can't see it, so buy another. Spice racks went out of style in the 80's, so whatcha gonna do? 

### Here's a quick thought on a better way to store spices... 

Buy some little transparent rectangular bags. They should be relatively robust, so get ones made of the thickest plastic you can find. 

Make a little tray just wide enough to hold them. We made ours out of cardboard and tape, as you can see, but you can find a more elegant solution if you like! 

Take a permanent marker, write the name of the spice on the bag, decant them from their pots and arrange them in alphabetical order. You may need an overflow tray like us if you have lots of spices. 

**Voila - you'll never lose a spice again!**
