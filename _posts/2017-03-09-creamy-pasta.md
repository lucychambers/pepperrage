# Tagliatelle with Tomatoes & Crème Fraîche

# Ingredients 

(Serves 2, very easily scalable)

* 6-8 nests of Tagliatelle
* 1 vine of sweet cherry tomatoes (Approx 16 tomatoes)
* 2 tbsp crème fraîche 
* Olive oil 
* Salt & pepper
* Sprig of basil
* Vegetarian parmesan (Optional: to serve)

# Recipe 

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F, Gas 6)
2. Put a pan of water on to boil for the pasta. Salt it well. 
3. Wash the tomatoes and place them on a baking tray. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper then drizzle with olive oil. 
4. Pop the tomatoes in the oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until they are well cooked through and the skin is well blistered.
5. If using dried pasta, cook this now. 
5. While the pasta is cooking. Remove the cherry tomatoes from their vine. Place them in a frying pan with a touch more oil. 
6. Over a low heat, add the crème fraîche and lightly crush the tomatoes. Cook for 2-3 minutes, but don't let it boil. 
7. Before draining the pasta, add a couple of spoons of the pasta water to the sauce. Now drain the pasta and mix into the sauce. 
8. Serve in large, deep bowls with a sprig of basil, a dusting of pepper and a sprinkle of parmesan.

# Tagliatelle with Prawns, Sambal Oelek & Crème Fraîche

*Note: This recipe is much quicker than the tomato dish. The prawn sauce can be cooked at the very last minute. Pasta can obviously be combined.* 

# Ingredients 

(Serves 2, very easily scalable)

* 6-8 nests of Tagliatelle
* Aprox 12 shell-off fresh/frozen Jumbo Prawns (or more larger ones)
* 1 tbsp sambal oelek
* 2 tbsp crème fraîche 
* Olive Oil 
* Salt & Pepper

# Recipe 

1. Put a pan of water on to boil for the pasta. Salt it well. Add pasta and cook. 
2. When the pasta is almost ready, heat a frying pan with some olive oil. Quickly fry the prawns for just a couple of minutes (until they are just about to turn pink)
3. Just before the prawns are fully cooked, add the sambal oelek and stir well. Then quickly, add the crème fraîche. Cook for 2-3 minutes, but don't let it boil. 
4. Before draining the pasta, add a couple of spoons of the pasta water to the sauce. Now drain the pasta and mix into the sauce.
5. Serve in large, deep bowls.
